Road Reporter
============

Reporting Potholes, Damaged Roads and Garbage using Android Phone.

##Context and Problem

Road Expansion in Kathmandu was carried out recently. The roads in Kathmandu has been only recently built. However there is no scientific and planned approach to many road reated activites. People have illegally dug holes in road, left exposed potholes and in some cases completely destroyed the newly built roads. These roads cause difficulty to both the street pedistrians and also to vicheal owners. The problem gets even worse in the monsoon season.
Another common problem in streets of Kathamndu is solid waste disposal. There are cases in where people recklessly throw garbage in the street. 


##Our Solution
Road Reporter is a mobile app that allows people people to take pictures of the above mentioned problems and report them. Users can select the catogery of problem and add description to the report. The reports are then visualized in a web map. 

##Status
Both android app and web based visulization of the reports have been completed. You can download the Mobile App from Google's play store(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kll.roadreporter). The web based visualization is available at our website (http://www.kathmandulivinglabs.org/roadreport/). These reports are also used in another KLL Project. 

##Anticipated Impact
We believe that this project will engage citizen and create awerness among them. The project will also allow local government to see and address the concerns of their citizens.
